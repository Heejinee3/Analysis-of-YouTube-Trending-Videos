# Data Analysis of YouTube Trending Videos

### Introduction

YouTube is a video sharing platform serviced by Google. 
As the largest video sharing site in the world, YouTube users can watch, upload, and share videos. 
Anyone using a computer could upload videos, making them visible to millions of people in minutes. 
It is used in various fields for communication in society. 
It is used in most fields such as marketing, politics, education, games, entertainment, music, and sports.
According to the 'Social media and Scanning portal Trend report 2020' of Opensurvey,
which is an online-based survey firm in Korea, YouTube becomes peerless social media platform. 
The statistics says that it hits 1st place for 3 years. 
Furthermore, even the growth in the importance of YouTube is steadily increasing. 
It is causing the gap to widen between social media continuously.
Then, what keeps YouTube being a largest part in this new trend in Korea? 
The findings of the Opensurvey suggest, the secret of its success is in richer contents that are provided to the users.
In the past, people use Facebook or Kakaostory to build relationships with friends through online services. 
But now, many people use social media to get variety of contents, for the sake of interests and needs (not for just chatting). 
Ratio of the users who use social media to make some communications between individuals has halved in past 4 years. 
These changes show that how important the contents are to this business, especially in the deluge of information.
So, our goal in this project report is to describe characteristics of videos drawing large amount of viewers. 
Taking these features into consideration, strategic planning to get more views, subscribers, and traffic to your video will be easier.
